# demo-mbo

This is a collection of short demo notebooks for using human-in-the-loop `mlr3mbo` for the AAAI-23 Bridge Program.
Some prior knowledge of R is required to follow along the notebook.   
The interested coder can refer to the [mlr3book](https://mlr3book.mlr-org.com/) for detailed explanations and examples.

Content:

1.  [`R6` basics](r6-basics.Rmd)
